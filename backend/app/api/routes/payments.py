"""
Simulated payment flow.
========================
No real payment gateway is wired up yet. Calling POST /api/payments/pay
immediately marks the current user's fee as paid and returns a fake
transaction reference, so the whole flow can be demoed end-to-end.

To switch to a real gateway (e.g. Razorpay) later:
  1. Create an order with the gateway inside `pay_fee` (or a new
     `/create-order` endpoint) instead of marking the payment paid directly.
  2. Add a `/verify` endpoint that checks the gateway's signature before
     calling `_on_payment_success` below.
Everything downstream of "a payment just succeeded" (`_on_payment_success`)
does not need to change.
